# Sign_Language_Detection

This project is a comprehensive system for sign language detection that combines real-time data collection, preprocessing, model training, and gesture recognition using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The aim is to provide an efficient solution for recognizing hand gestures corresponding to the English alphabet, enabling seamless communication for individuals relying on sign language.

The data collection phase utilizes a webcam to capture live hand gesture images. The region of interest (ROI) for the hand is isolated, followed by preprocessing techniques such as grayscale conversion, Gaussian blurring, and adaptive thresholding to enhance the quality of the images. The processed images are organized into 26 gesture classes corresponding to the English alphabet, forming the training and testing datasets.

For the detection task, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented using Keras. The architecture features multiple convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction, followed by flattening and fully connected dense layers for classification. The final softmax layer predicts one of the 26 gesture categories. To improve model robustness and accuracy, data augmentation techniques, including rescaling, rotation, and zoom, are applied to the training data. The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer with a categorical cross-entropy loss function and achieves significant performance gains across 50 training epochs. Evaluation metrics such as training and validation accuracy and loss trends are visualized to monitor model performance.

In the detection phase, the trained CNN model processes live webcam feeds to detect and classify hand gestures in real time. The system extracts the hand ROI from each frame, applies the trained model to predict the corresponding sign language gesture, and overlays the predicted alphabet on the video feed. This provides a user-friendly interface for real-time gesture recognition. 

This project offers a robust and efficient solution for detecting and interpreting sign language gestures, paving the way for practical applications in communication and accessibility technologies.
